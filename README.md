A serverless Node.js application using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to retrieve tasks for a to-do list application.

# Features

- Fetches tasks from a DynamoDB table
- Built with Node.js and TypeScript
- Implements OOP principles with proper class structure
- Uses async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Implements robust error handling
- Deployed as an AWS Lambda function with API Gateway

# Architecture
This project follows a serverless architecture with:

- `AWS Lambda:` Handles HTTP requests
- `API Gateway:` Exposes the Lambda function as an HTTP endpoint
- `DynamoDB:` Stores task data
- `CloudWatch Logs:` Stores function execution logs

``` 
# Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+ and npm
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Serverless Framework CLI


## Setup Instructions

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/fahadyaseen001/Plutus21-Capital-Coding-Task.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Plutus21-Capital-Coding-Task
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Configure AWS credentials

```bash
 aws configure
```
### Create S3 Bucket

Create an S3 Bucket (Deployment Bucket) named "todo-aws-s3-bucket-test" using AWS Console or u can create your own bucket with any name and manually change the deployment bucket name to your `serverless.yml` under the `deploymentBucket` section:

```yml
deploymentBucket:
    name: your-s3-bucket-name
```

### Create DynamoDB Table

Create a DynamoDB table named `TasksTable` with a primary key `id` (String).You can do this manually in the AWS Console or add the following to your `serverless.yml` under the `resources` section:

```yml
resources:
  Resources:
    TasksTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        TableName: TasksTable
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: id
            AttributeType: S
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: id
            KeyType: HASH
```

### Deploy the service

```bash
npx serverless deploy
```
## API Endpoint
After deployment, you'll get an endpoint URL like:
```bash
https://xk2tydgzf4.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/tasks
```
## Usage
Send a GET request to the endpoint to retrieve tasks:
```bash
curl https://xk2tydgzf4.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/tasks
```
## Testing Locally

To test the function locally:
```bash
npm test
```

## Thought Process For Understanding The Task & Coding It ðŸ’­

- Started by analyzing the serverless API requirements and listing them for clarity
- Identified key components: AWS Lambda, TypeScript, DynamoDB, and OOP principles
- Designed project structure with clean separation of concerns (models, services, handlers)
- Created the Task model interface to define data structure
- Implemented Lamba Function Implementation class using OOP principles for DynamoDB operations
- Applied comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Created utility functions for standardized API responses
- Built Lambda function handler with async/await pattern for better readability
- Configured serverless.yml for infrastructure as code
- Resolved IAM permission challenges during deployment
- Tested endpoint functionality with DynamoDB integration
- Optimized Lambda performance and error logging
- Maintained clean code with proper naming conventions and TypeScript typing


## Required IAM Permissions
The deployment user needs these permissions:

- CloudFormation full access
- Lambda full access
- API Gateway administrator
- DynamoDB full access
- CloudWatch Logs full access
- IAM role creation permissions

## Thank You ðŸ’Œ
